# Bank-Loan-Performance-Dashboard-Analysis-of-Loan-Quality-Funding-and-Risk-Metrics
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of bank loan data using Python and Power BI. It aims to provide insights into loan approval patterns, customer demographics, and financial performance to support decision-making in financial institutions.

## 📁 Files Included

- `financial_loan.csv`: Raw dataset containing loan and customer information.
- `bank_loan_data_insights.pbix`: Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations and insights derived from the dataset.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze financial loan data to identify key patterns and trends that influence loan approval, default risk, and customer behavior. This analysis supports better credit risk assessment and customer segmentation strategies.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python** *(optional/if used)*: For data cleaning and preprocessing (if applicable).
- **Excel/CSV**: For data inspection and initial review.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Identification of key features affecting loan approval (e.g., credit score, income, loan term).
- Default rate trends based on customer demographics.
- Business recommendations for improving loan acceptance strategies.

## 📝 Steps Performed

1. **Data Understanding**: Explored structure and types of variables.
2. **Data Cleaning** *(if applicable)*: Removed null values, handled outliers, formatted data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Distribution of approved vs. rejected loans.
   - Default rate by loan type, income, and credit history.
4. **Dashboard Development**:
   - KPI cards (e.g., Total Loans, Default Rate, Approval Rate).
   - Filters for Loan Status, Gender, Region, etc.
   - Bar, Pie, and Line Charts for breakdowns by category and time.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the Power BI `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore insights using built-in filters and visuals.
3. Load `financial_loan.csv` if refreshing or rebuilding the dashboard.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Incorporate machine learning to predict loan approval.
- Add more granular time-series analysis if timestamps are available.
- Automate monthly updates using Power BI Service and Gateway.
